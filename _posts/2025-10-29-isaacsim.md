<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Exploring camera + LiDAR pipelines for indoor drone localization in Isaac Sim 5.0. </p>

## 1) Goal & Context

This post starts documenting how I set up **Isaac Sim 5.0** to prototype **indoor, GPS‑denied drone localization** pipelines. I wanted a way to:
- Simulate **autonomous drone navigation**,
- Visualize **camera** and **LiDAR** sensor data,
- Test out **localization** algorithms and compare **known‑map** vs. **unknown‑map** workflows.

This short tutorial video below was a great start for me:
- **Video:** “Get Started with Isaac Sim 5.0 (pip install)” — <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV2hqw8wu3U>

## 2) Install Isaac Sim (pip)

### 2.1 Prerequisites (Workstation Specs)

Nvidia lists the following requirements for running Isaac Sim 5.x[^reqs]:

- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (Linux x64) or Windows 10/11  
- **CPU:** 7th‑gen **Intel i7** / **Ryzen 5** or better (9th‑gen i7 / Ryzen 7 recommended; i9/Ryzen 9 ideal)  
- **RAM:** **32 GB minimum** (64 GB recommended)  
- **GPU:** Recent **GeForce RTX**/**RTX Ada** or pro‑series RTX, with **≥16 GB VRAM** for heavier scenes  
- **Storage:** Fast SSD; dozens of GB free for assets and caches  

You can verify your machine using the [Isaac Sim Compatibility Checker](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/5.0.0/installation/quick-install.html). In my case, I have a dual-boot desktop PC with Ubuntu 22.04 installed on its own SSD, and that meets Nvidia's requirements. I also already had ROS2 Humble installed.

### 2.2 Create a Python 3.11 environment (Ubuntu 22.04)
Depending on whether you wish to use Isaac Sim 5.x (latest) or Isaac Sim 4.x (supports relevant plugins such as Pegasus which currently aren't supported on 5.x yet at time of writing), keep in mind that Isaac Sim 5.x requires Python 3.11, and Isaac Sim 4.x requires Python 3.10.


```bash
# Create a working folder (will create virtual env and pip instal)
mkdir -p ~/isaacsim && cd ~/isaacsim

# Ensure Python 3.11 is available
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev

# Create & activate a virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv ~/venvs/isaacsim-5
source env_isaacsim/bin/activate
python -V   # expect 3.11.x
```

### 2.3 Install Isaac Sim 5.0 (pip) and Launch
It is also possible to download and install from the Isaac Sim Documentation website, but doing pip install with your virtual environment sourced allows it to be contained in that environment, and if needed you'd be able to easily install another version of Isaac Sim within a separate environment with few issues. 

```bash
# From inside the venv
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install isaacsim[all,extscache]==5.0.0 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
```

Launch with:

```bash
isaacsim
```


---

## 3) ROS 2 Bridge Setup (Humble)

I initially had an issue where the **ROS 2 bridge didn’t start** because my system‑installed ROS 2 conflicted with Isaac Sim’s internal ROS libraries. The fix was to **use Isaac Sim’s internal ROS 2 and FastDDS**, and **avoid sourcing** the system ROS2 (which runs Python 3.10) in that terminal.

```bash
# (Optional) Activate the venv you installed Isaac Sim into
source env_isaacsim/bin/activate

# Point Isaac Sim’s ROS 2 bridge at its internal Humble runtime
export ROS_DISTRO=humble
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp

# IMPORTANT: use the internal bridge libs that ship with Isaac Sim
# Replace $ISAACSIM_PY with your site-packages path for the venv
export ISAACSIM_PY=$(python -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages()[0])")
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$ISAACSIM_PY/isaacsim/exts/isaacsim.ros2.bridge/humble/lib"

# Ensure you DON'T pull in system ROS 2 in this terminal
unset AMENT_PREFIX_PATH COLCON_PREFIX_PATH

# Launch Isaac Sim
isaacsim
```

> **Also check:** `Window → Extensions`, look up `ros2` and verify **`isaacsim.ros2.bridge`** is **enabled**.

<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">ROS2 Bridge Extension. </p>

When using separate shells for `rviz2`, `rqt`, or other ROS2 nodes, start by sourcing ROS2, and ensure you have a **consistent** domain ID:

```bash
# Source ROS2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
# In every ROS 2 shell you’ll use with this sim:
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 # I actually used the default 0 so no need for this
# (Optional) persist it
echo 'export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## 4) Add an environment, drone, and sensors



### 4.1 Create an environment

Once the simulator is started up (this can take some time for the first launch of Isaac Sim), create an environment for a drone to interact with. You can start with a Ground Plane with physics/collisions enabled, or browse and import one of Isaac Sim's environment assets (like its high-fidelity warehouse). You can also 3D scan your own room with your phone (using apps like Polycam or Scaniverse), edit in Blender and literally drag and drop it inside the simulator.

**In Isaac Sim:**  
`Create → Environments → Asset Browser`

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/asset-browser.png" title="Select Asset Browser" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Create → Environment → Asset Browser. </p>

You'll then be able to browse all of Nvidia's assets under the Isaac Sim Assets (Beta) tab in the bottom left. Simply drag and drop the warehouse into the stage/viewport.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/import-warehouse.png" title="Isaac Sim: Import Warehouse" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Drag and drop the warehouse into the stage. </p>

### 4.2 Bring in a reference quad (Iris)

A convenient, open asset is the **Iris** quad from **Pegasus Simulator**[^pegasus] (built on Isaac Sim). Download `iris.usd` from the repo [here](https://github.com/PegasusSimulator/PegasusSimulator/tree/main/extensions/pegasus.simulator/ pegasus/simulator/assets/Robots/Iris) and add it to your scene. You can also use one of Isaac Sim's drone assets (like the Crazyflie) or import your own.


**In Isaac Sim:**  
`File → Add Reference… → iris.usd`

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/import-drone.png" title="Import Iris Drone" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Drag and drop Iris drone. </p>



> Press **Play**: the drone will fall if it’s not constrained/controlled yet—that’s expected.

### 4.3 Add sensors and parent them to the body

Under the asset browser, select and drag a **Camera** and a **LiDAR/Ray‑cast** sensor into the stage.  

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/import-lidar.png" title="Import LIDAR" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Drag and drop LIDAR sensor. </p>

In the **Stage** tree, **drag the sensor prims under the drone’s body** (e.g., `/World/Iris/base_link`) so they move with the vehicle when sim starts.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/stage-tree.png" title="Stage Tree" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Drag the imported sensors under the drone's body prim so that they move with the drone during simulation. </p>

You can preview a camera feed directly in Isaac Sim via **`Window → Viewport → Viewport 2`**, then select the camera.


{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/isaacsim/import-drone.png" title="Import Iris Drone" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
<p class="text-muted text-center mt-2">Drag and drop Iris drone. </p>


### 4.3 Publish to ROS 2 topics

With the **ROS 2 Bridge enabled**, select each sensor prim and enable the ROS publisher (UI varies by sensor). Make sure the **Camera Prim**/topic names are set. Double‑check that your **`ROS_DOMAIN_ID`** matches across terminals.

> Historically you had to wire an **Action Graph** by hand; the newer publishers **auto‑generate** the graph. You can still inspect it under **`Window → Action Graph`**.

---

## 5) Inspect Topics in ROS 2 Tools

In a **new terminal** (do **not** source a system ROS that conflicts with Python 3.11), run your usual tools:

```bash
# If you DO have a system ROS 2 Humble you want to use,
# source it in a separate terminal, not the sim’s terminal:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Be sure the domain matches the sim’s terminal
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42

# Examples:
ros2 topic list
rviz2
rqt
```

### 5.1 Foxglove

Foxglove is a nice web viewer for quick dashboards. Use the ROS 2 bridge:

```bash
ros2 launch foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge_launch.xml
```

Then open Foxglove in the browser, add the WebSocket connection, and visualize **camera**, **depth**, and **LiDAR** overlays.

---

## 6) Notes on Known‑Map vs Unknown‑Map Localization

- **Known map (AMCL / NDT / ICP‑based):**  
  Import your environment mesh/point cloud as a static map; fuse **LiDAR**/**stereo**/**RGB‑D** odometry with scan matching against the map. Good for repeatable facilities.
- **Unknown map (VIO / SLAM):**  
  Use **VIO** or **RGB‑D SLAM** (e.g., VINS‑Fusion, ORB‑SLAM3‑RGBD, RTAB‑Map) to build the map on the fly; useful for ad‑hoc indoor spaces. Isaac Sim’s controllable lighting and textures help test robustness.
- **Bridging both:**  
  Initialize with VIO, then switch to map‑based localization once a prior or loop closure is available.

(Implementation details are out of scope here, but this setup gives you the sensor topics you need to experiment.)

---

## 7) Troubleshooting Cheatsheet

- **Bridge loads but no topics:** Confirm `isaacsim.ros2.bridge` is enabled; verify `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp`; check `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` matches.
- **`librmw_fastrtps_cpp.so` not found:** Re‑export the **internal** bridge lib path (see Section 3) and *avoid* sourcing system ROS in the sim’s shell. [^rosbridge]
- **Python mismatch:** Isaac Sim 5.0 expects **Python 3.11**; rebuild your venv and reinstall. [^py311]
- **Performance/VRAM:** Reduce viewport resolution, disable post‑FX, simplify materials, or switch to headless rendering when only streaming sensors.
- **Iris asset issues:** If a particular USD material fails to compile, try a clean cache, alternate material, or a different Iris variant. (Rare, but reported on some setups.)
