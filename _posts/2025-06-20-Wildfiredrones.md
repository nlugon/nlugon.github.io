Wildfires have become bigger, more destructive, and harder to deal with, and with this we need new tools and smarter coordination to keep up. That’s where drones come in—offering real-time insight, safer operations, and faster response when every second counts.

But first, let’s quickly look at how wildfires start and how we currently fight them.

  <p class="text-muted mt-2">The Fire Triangle: heat, fuel, and oxygen must all be present.</p>

#### How Wildfires Start

A fire needs three components to start:

- **Heat** (like from lightning, a spark, or even a hot engine)  
- **Fuel** (dry leaves, grass, trees—you name it)  
- **Oxygen** (plenty of it in the air around us)

The combination of the three makes a **fire triangle**—and it’s a good rule of thumb: remove any one of the three, and the fire can’t keep going.

That said, even when all three are present, a fire might not ignite right away. That’s because you also need enough energy for a **sustained chemical reaction**—what’s known as the fourth side in the **fire tetrahedron**. It’s that reaction that really kicks things off and sustains the fire.

This is why dry vegetation, heat, and particularly wind make such a dangerous combo. Once a fire gets going, wind not only spreads the flames but also feeds it with more oxygen—turning a small spark into a fast-moving threat.

---

#### When Fires Get Out of Hand

Fires can start small—but in dry, windy conditions, they can spread fast. Once they grow too large to be put out directly, the focus shifts to **slowing it down** and protecting critical areas. That’s when it becomes about **containment**—cutting firebreaks, redirecting the fire, and buying time.

---

#### The Usual Playbook

Fighting wildfires takes a combination of:

- **Ground crews**, digging trenches and cutting fuel lines  
- **Dozers**, creating wide paths the fire can’t cross  
- **Backburns**, where small, controlled fires are lit to starve the wildfire of fuel  
- **Aircraft**, dropping water or retardant and relaying situational awareness

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/backburning.jpg" title="Controlled backburn being lit to stop the wildfire from spreading" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Terrain and weather play a huge role—steep hills and high winds make everything harder. And while aircraft are powerful tools, they’re only effective when synced with what’s happening on the ground.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/air-ground-coordination.jpg" title="Aerial and ground firefighting crews working together" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

---

That’s where **drones** can change the game.

From spotting flare-ups early to navigating smoky skies where it’s too risky to send pilots, drones can fill critical gaps—and help first responders work faster, safer, and smarter.

Let’s take a look at how they’re already being used—and how NASA’s ACERO project is helping turn that vision into reality.

---

#### Drones Step In: NASA’s ACERO Project

While firefighters and aircraft are doing everything they can on the ground and in the air, there’s still a big gap: visibility. Right now, planes and helicopters can’t safely fly at night or through thick smoke—meaning there are times when fires keep burning, but aircraft are grounded.

NASA’s **ACERO project** (Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations) is working to change that.

Led by NASA Ames in California, ACERO is developing tools to make wildfire response smarter, faster, and safer—starting with drones.

---

#### Smarter Airspace = Safer Skies

One of ACERO’s key technologies is the **Portable Airspace Management System (PAMS)**. It’s a suitcase-sized kit that gives drone pilots and fire crews a live picture of what’s happening in the air—even in rugged terrain or when cell service is spotty.

With PAMS, crews can:

- Track where every drone or aircraft is flying  
- See shared fire zones and flight plans  
- Avoid collisions—even in smoke or nighttime conditions

This means drones can safely operate **24/7**, helping with aerial suppression, spotting flare-ups, delivering gear, or even setting controlled burns—all from the ground, without risking pilot lives.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/pams-drone-test.jpg" title="NASA testing PAMS during wildfire drone simulation in Salinas, CA (March 2025)" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

---

#### Real-World Testing in California

In March 2025, NASA put PAMS to the test in the mountains near Salinas, CA. Researchers simulated a wildfire response, flying drones and a vertical takeoff aircraft while coordinating everything using PAMS. Despite rough terrain and limited connectivity, the system worked—sharing flight data, managing routes, and helping coordinate multiple aircraft.

Even Cal Fire officials were there to give feedback. They saw the potential of this system to **transform how aircraft are managed during wildfires**, especially when visibility is poor.

> “We need every advantage possible when it comes to saving lives and property... and ACERO technology will give responders critical new tools.”  
> —Carol Carroll, NASA Aeronautics Research

#### What’s Next?

ACERO isn’t stopping here. The team is working with government agencies, commercial partners like **Joby Aviation**, and wildfire crews to keep testing and improving these systems. The goal? Make drone support a **standard part of wildfire operations**—day or night, smoke or clear skies.

By unlocking safer, more flexible air operations, NASA’s ACERO project is helping first responders do more—without putting more lives at risk.

Wildfires are no joke. In recent years, they’ve gotten bigger, more destructive, and harder to deal with. To really understand how we can fight them—and how drones might help—it’s worth looking at what makes a wildfire start in the first place.

*Fire needs three things: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Take away just one, and the fire dies out.*


#### How Wildfires Start

A fire needs three components to start:

- **Heat** (like from lightning, a spark, or even a hot engine)  
- **Fuel** (dry leaves, grass, trees—you name it)  
- **Oxygen** (plenty of it in the air around us)

The combination of the three makes a **fire triangle**—and it’s a good rule of thumb: remove any one of the three, and the fire can’t keep going.

That said, even when all three are present, a fire might not ignite right away. That’s because you also need enough energy for a **sustained chemical reaction**—what’s known as the fourth side in the **fire tetrahedron**. It’s that reaction that really kicks things off and sustains the fire.

This is why dry vegetation, heat, and particularly wind make such a dangerous combo. Once a fire gets going, wind not only spreads the flames but also feeds it with more oxygen—turning a small spark into a fast-moving threat.


#### When Things Get Out of Hand

At first, a fire might just be a small patch. If someone spots it early, it can usually get it under control. But if the fire isn’t caught quickly—or if it’s in a remote area—it can explode in size. At some point, the goal shifts from *putting it out* to just *keeping it from getting worse*.

That’s when it’s all about **containment**: building firebreaks, slowing it down, and protecting towns, roads, or power lines.

> Fires can go from manageable to unstoppable in minutes—so every second counts.

#### So, How Do We Actually Fight Wildfires?

You might think the best way to fight a wildfire is to just spray a giant hose at it—but it’s way more complicated than that. Unlike house fires, wildfires can cover **hundreds or thousands of acres** of rugged, fast-changing terrain. You can’t just park a fire truck next to it and put it out.

So instead, firefighters use a mix of **direct** and **indirect** strategies—and it all depends on how big the fire is, where it’s located, and what the weather conditions are.

---

### 🔥 Fighting Fire with Fire (Literally)

When a wildfire gets big, it often makes more sense to fight it *indirectly*. That means instead of going after the flames head-on, crews work around the fire to **remove its fuel**—so it has nowhere left to burn.

Here’s how that’s done:

- **Hand tools & chainsaws**: Crews carve out control lines by clearing brush and digging into the soil.
- **Dozers**: Bulldozers create wide firebreaks that can stop the fire’s advance.
- **Backburns**: Firefighters sometimes set small, controlled fires inside these containment lines (called *backfires*) to burn up the fuel in a controlled way—so when the main fire gets there, it runs out of stuff to burn.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/backburning.jpg" title="Controlled backburn being lit to stop the wildfire from spreading" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

It’s a slow and careful process, but one of the most effective ways to keep a fire from turning into a disaster.

---

### 🧭 Terrain and Weather Matter. A Lot.

Whether a fire is on flat ground or a steep hillside totally changes the game. Fires tend to **move faster uphill** because heat rises, and wind or dry conditions can make them even more unpredictable.

That’s why fire crews scout the area first—to figure out where to set up containment lines and what resources they’ll need. If the fire’s small and conditions are good, they might try to hit it directly. But if it’s large and already making a run, it’s usually safer to go with an indirect approach.

---

### 🚁 When Aircraft Join the Fight

Aircraft are a huge help—but they’re not the entire solution. Planes and helicopters don’t “put out” the fire. What they really do is **slow it down** or steer it away from homes, roads, or fire crews. That buys time for ground teams to do their work safely.

There are a few different types of aircraft:

- **Helicopters**: Great for dropping water, moving firefighters, or doing rescues in tough terrain.
- **Tanker planes**: Drop red fire retardant in front of the fire to slow its progress.
- **Tactical planes**: Fly above everything to help coordinate where drops should happen.

Cal Fire, for example, has one of the largest aerial firefighting fleets in the world. But even they say aircraft only work when coordinated closely with what’s happening on the ground.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/air-ground-coordination.jpg" title="Aerial and ground firefighting crews working together" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

So yes—aircraft are powerful tools. But it’s really the **team effort** between the air and ground that makes the difference.

#### Fighting Fires from the Sky: A Closer Look at Aerial Firefighting

When it comes to wildfires, ground crews do a ton of the heavy lifting—but some of the most dramatic and essential work happens in the air. Planes and helicopters play different roles, but they all work together to help slow down and contain fires so ground teams can do their jobs safely.

---

### 🛩️ Tactical Aircraft – The Air Traffic Controllers of Wildfires

Let’s start with the tactical planes. These aren’t the ones doing water drops—they’re more like air traffic controllers in the sky.

Cal Fire mostly uses old military **OV-10 “Bronco”** planes for this job. They fly above the fire for hours, watching everything that’s going on and helping direct tankers and helicopters where they’re needed most. These planes can even act as **“lead planes”**, flying in first to guide larger tankers to the right drop zone.

They’re fast, nimble, and stay in the air much longer than the tankers that need to land and refill every run. Without these guys, things in the sky would get chaotic pretty fast.

---

### 🚒 Tanker Planes – Laying Down the Red Lines

Next up are the **tankers**—these are the aircraft that actually drop fire retardant or water. 

Cal Fire’s workhorse here is the **Grumman S-2T**, a smaller ex-Navy plane that can carry about 1,200 gallons (around 4,500 liters) of retardant. These planes are quick, and because they can refill while their engines are still running (“hot loading”), they’re back in the air in just minutes.

The S-2Ts are great for **initial attacks**—getting to a fire early and keeping it from spreading. They usually drop retardant **in front of** the fire to slow it down or steer it away from homes, roads, or fire crews. That red stuff you see in photos? That’s the line they drop.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/s2t-drop.jpg" title="A Cal Fire S-2T drops fire retardant to slow down a wildfire" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

---

### ✈️ Large and Very Large Air Tankers – The Heavy Hitters

For big fires, Cal Fire and other agencies bring out the big guns: Large Air Tankers (LATs) and Very Large Air Tankers (VLATs). These are usually old commercial jets that have been converted into flying fire trucks.

Here are some of the big names:

- **MD-87 and BAe 146** – Mid-size jet tankers that carry over 11,000 liters of retardant.
- **C-130 “Hercules”** – A legendary military cargo plane that can carry around 15,000 liters.
- **DC-10** – A monster of a plane that can drop 35,000+ liters in one go.
- **747 Supertanker** (now retired) – This beast could unload nearly 68,000 liters (that’s like dumping 56 helicopter buckets in one pass!).

These planes don’t mess around. They’re used when a fire is out of control and there’s a need to lay down **massive lines of retardant** in one sweep. The downside? They take longer to refill and need longer runways.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/dc10-drop.jpg" title="A DC-10 drops a massive line of retardant during a wildfire" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

---

### 🚁 Helicopters – The Workhorses of the Sky

Helicopters are super versatile. They can:

- Drop water or retardant
- Transport firefighters and gear
- Perform rescue missions
- Fly at night
- Operate in places planes can’t

Cal Fire’s fleet includes the **Bell UH-1H “Super Huey”**, which carries around 1,200 liters in a bucket, and the newer **Sikorsky S-70i Black Hawk**, which can drop heavier loads and fly night missions.

There are also private helicopters like the **AW139** and **Sikorsky S-76** out flying missions too. On a big fire day, you might see a dozen or more helicopters looping from lakes or tanks to the fireline, over and over again.

---

### ✈️ Super Scoopers – The Water Chasers

Then there’s a special kind of aircraft called **“Super Scoopers”** (like the Bombardier CL-415). These planes **skim across lakes or the ocean** to refill their tanks, then fly back and dump water over the fire. It’s like a real-life video game: scoop, fly, drop, repeat.

These aircraft are especially useful near coastal or lake-heavy areas, like around LA or Northern California. During the Palisades Fire, two Canadian Super Scoopers made **dozens of back-to-back water runs**, scooping from the Pacific and dropping it over flames just minutes later.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/super-scooper.jpg" title="A CL-415 Super Scooper refills with water from a nearby lake" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

---

### 🚁 When It All Comes Together

All of these aircraft—tactical planes, tankers, helicopters, Super Scoopers—are part of a coordinated air show, working in sync with ground crews. The tactical planes direct the operation from above, while tankers lay down lines and helicopters do precision work. Some tankers even fly **eight or more missions a day**.

Without this aerial support, many wildfires would spread far faster, especially in steep or hard-to-reach terrain.

### 🏠 When Fires Get Close to People

If homes or buildings are in the fire’s path, protecting those structures becomes priority number one. Crews may clear brush, lay down retardant, or even wrap buildings in heat-resistant material. Helicopters and tankers might fly in to defend these areas too.

It all depends on what’s happening on the ground. Firefighters are constantly making judgment calls about where to act first, based on safety, resources, and weather.

---

In short: fighting wildfires is part science, part muscle, and part strategy. It takes coordination across dozens (sometimes hundreds) of people—from crews digging lines in the dirt, to pilots flying through smoke, to weather experts watching the forecast.

#### How We Fight Wildfires Today

There’s a lot that goes into firefighting. You’ve probably seen clips of helicopters dumping water or big planes spraying red fire retardant. But there’s more:

- **Ground teams** cut paths through vegetation and dig trenches to stop the fire from spreading.
- **Helicopters and planes** fly over to drop water or retardant, especially where it’s too dangerous to send people.
- **Smokejumpers** (yes, that’s a real thing) parachute into hard-to-reach areas to start fighting the fire on the ground.

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/firefighting-aircraft.jpg" title="Aerial firefighting aircraft dropping retardant" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

All of this is coordinated from command centers that keep track of where the fire’s heading, where crews are, and what weather is on the way. It's a massive team effort—and even with all that, some fires are just too fast or unpredictable.

---

That’s where drones come in.
