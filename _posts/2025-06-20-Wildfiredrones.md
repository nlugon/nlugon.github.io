### 1. Introduction

Wildfires are becoming **more frequent, larger in scale, and more destructive** than ever before. In 2024 alone, the U.S. saw nearly **65,000 wildfires** burn approximately **8.9 million acres**—one of the highest annual totals on record—and came just after the 2023 season, which burned 2.7 million acres. Meanwhile, wildfire suppression costs in 2023 reached **$2.7 billion**, contributing to over **$3.17 billion in total damages**. Beyond economic impacts, wildfires increasingly threaten lives, infrastructure, air quality, and can also exacerbate climate change through massive CO₂ emissions.


#### 1.1 How Wildfires Work: The Fire Tetrahedron

To understand how to fight wildfires, it helps to understand how they ignite and spread. The **fire tetrahedron** outlines the four key components required for fire:

- **Heat**
- **Fuel**
- **Oxygen**
- **Chemical chain reaction**

Eliminating any one of these can suppress a fire. Traditional firefighting methods focus on removing fuel (e.g., controlled burns), reducing heat (e.g., blasting water), or preventing supply in oxygen and interfering with the chemical reaction (e.g., in part what fire retardants do).

#### 1.2 State of the Art in Wildfire Response

Current wildfire response involves a mix of satellite imaging, manned aircraft (like tankers and helicopters), ground crews, and predictive fire modeling. These methods offer valuable capabilities, but also face major **limitations**:

- **Surveillance is infrequent** and often delayed
- **Aircraft operations are limited** by daylight, visibility, and turbulence
- **Communications infrastructure is inconsistent**, especially in remote areas
- **Multiple agencies** must coordinate with different technologies

NASA’s assessment with the U.S. Forest Service and other agencies confirmed these gaps. There’s a pressing need for **persistent surveillance**, **interoperable communications**, and **modern airspace management** to safely coordinate diverse aircraft, especially in chaotic emergency environments.

#### 1.3 Where Drones Fit In

Drones can help **fill critical gaps** in wildfire response:

- They can fly **day or night**, even when visibility is poor
- They offer **persistent aerial presence**, acting as “extra eyes” for command centers
- They can be deployed rapidly for **search and rescue**, **emergency deliveries**, **mapping**, or **live monitoring**
- They’re typically **less costly and easier to deploy** than manned aircraft

Unlike manned aircraft, drones don’t depend on pilot availability or crew rest cycles. They can be automated, pre-positioned, and scaled across incidents. But to **safely integrate** drones into wildfire airspace—alongside helicopters, tankers, and manned spotter aircraft—we need new **technological frameworks and tools** for coordination.

This is where NASA’s **ACERO project** steps in.

### 2. Introducing ACERO: A New Framework for Aerial Wildfire Coordination

To safely integrate drones into wildfire airspace, **NASA Ames Research Center** is leading the **Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO)** project. ACERO addresses critical challenges in wildfire response by developing technologies for:

- **Wildfire airspace management**
- **Resilient communications and surveillance**
- **Coordinated operations of both manned and unmanned aircraft**
- **Human-centered decision support systems**

One impactful outcome of ACERO so far is the development of the **Portable Airspace Management System (PAMS)**.

#### What is PAMS?

PAMS is a **rugged, field-deployable case** that houses all the essential tools a drone operator or mission supervisor needs that allow to safely coordinate drone operations during wildfire or emergency response efforts. The case includes:

- A computer with display and mission coordination software
- Radios and networking gear for air-to-air and air-to-ground communication
- Support for **real-time coordination between drones, helicopters, and command centers**

Its purpose is to allow **rapid, safe drone deployment in emergency scenarios**, without compromising **airspace safety**. During a wildfire, decisions must be made in seconds—not minutes. PAMS enables teams to:

- **Quickly obtain airspace clearance**
- **Coordinate with manned aircraft crews**
- **Avoid airspace conflicts between drones and other emergency aircraft**

By making situational awareness tools **portable and self-contained**, PAMS ensures that small teams operating in the field have access to the same coordination tools previously only available in large command centers.

#### Designed for Emergency Use

In a wildfire, conditions evolve rapidly. PAMS was built with these challenges in mind:

- **Fast deployment and boot-up**
- **User-friendly interface** so responders can focus on the mission, not the tech
- **Interoperable communication support**, accounting for the fact that multiple agencies (local, state, federal) may use different radios or protocols

In practice, PAMS functions like an **on-the-go UAS traffic control center**—helping drone pilots respond faster while maintaining visibility into a shared airspace environment. It’s not just about flying a drone—it’s about flying **safely**, in a space shared with crewed aircraft, multiple agencies, and unpredictable fire conditions.

### 3. Conclusion: Demonstrations, Human Factors, and What Comes Next

NASA’s ACERO team has already **demonstrated early versions of this technology** in the field—most notably in the rugged mountain ranges near **Monterey, California**. These flight exercises proved that drone coordination and wildfire airspace management can be executed more safely and efficiently using portable tools like PAMS.

But this is just the beginning. Several key areas are now being improved and expanded:

#### Human-Centered Interface Design

When dealing with fast-changing emergencies, **ease of use is essential**. One major focus is refining the PAMS software interface to ensure:

- **Minimal training is needed**, even for first-time users
- Interfaces are intuitive, clear, and reduce operator workload
- Critical information is displayed with appropriate prioritization and clarity

The goal is to make the system so easy and reliable that firefighters and drone operators **want to use it**—even under stress.

#### Flexible Communication Integration

Wildfire response involves **many agencies**—fire departments, forest service, military, local law enforcement—each with their own tools and protocols. A current challenge is ensuring PAMS can **integrate a wide variety of communication systems**, including:

- VHF/UHF radios
- LTE/cellular and SATCOM
- Mesh networks and ground relays

This level of flexibility is essential for **interoperability in the field** and is a key step toward making the technology widely adoptable.

#### Towards the Final PAMS Case

The ACERO team is also working on a finalized version of the PAMS unit—one that is:

- **Rugged** enough for harsh environments
- **Compact and easy to deploy**
- **Modular**, so it can adapt to future technologies or mission types

Ultimately, the vision is to **modernize aerial emergency response** using scalable, interoperable, and field-proven tools—empowering drone teams to operate **faster**, **safer**, and **more effectively**, even in the most challenging conditions.


### 4. Sidenote: Drone Incursions during Wildfires

As of **May 14, 2025**, there have already been **18 reported drone incursions** during active wildfire incidents. Every single one of these incidents **disrupted or delayed aerial firefighting operations**, putting lives and property at risk. 

When an unidentified drone not involved in response efforts (i.e. there to capture dramatic footage) is spotted near a wildfire, **firefighting aircraft must be grounded immediately**. Pilots cannot risk a midair collision with an unknown UAV. These delays cost critical time, slow containment efforts, and can allow fires to grow unchecked.

### 5. Extra: Portable Ground Radars for Increased Awareness and Safety

As the ACERO project progresses, one next step is the deployment of **portable ground-based radar systems** at the wildfire response perimeter. These systems would:

- Track and manage **authorized drones and crewed aircraft**
- Detect and geolocate **unauthorized or rogue drones** in real-time
- Support **safer and more scalable airspace operations** in high-tempo emergencies

This approach not only improves **situational awareness**, but also supports enforcement and safety—helping incident commanders take swift action if a drone threatens operations. Additional sidenote: foreshaddowing for a next blog post.
