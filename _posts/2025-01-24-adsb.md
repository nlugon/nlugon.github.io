## Introduction to ADS-B

ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) is a surveillance technology used in aviation to track aircraft in real-time. Equipped aircraft broadcast their position, velocity, altitude, and other parameters, allowing air traffic controllers and other planes to maintain situational awareness.

By collecting and analyzing ADS-B data over the years, we can identify common flight paths, observe global traffic density, and study patterns that define air travel around the world.

## Visualizing Flight Paths

Using ADS-B data from the past few years, we plotted the trajectories of commercial flights globally. Each flight path is visualized with a low opacity, creating a density map where overlapping paths reveal the most common routes.

<div id="map" style="height: 600px; width: 100%;"></div>

This map highlights:
- Major transoceanic routes, such as North America to Europe.
- Densely traveled domestic airspaces like the United States and Europe.
- Emerging markets with increasing flight density, like Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

### Python Code to Generate the Visualization

Hereâ€™s the Python code that processes ADS-B data and generates a visualization:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load ADS-B flight data (assume 'flights.csv' contains lat/lon for flight paths)
data = pd.read_csv('flights.csv')  # Columns: flight_id, latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp

# Plot setup
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))
plt.title("Global Commercial Flight Paths", fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel("Longitude", fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel("Latitude", fontsize=12)
plt.xlim(-180, 180)
plt.ylim(-90, 90)

# Scatter plot for flight paths
for flight_id, group in data.groupby('flight_id'):
    plt.plot(group['longitude'], group['latitude'], alpha=0.01, linewidth=0.5, color="blue")

# Enhance visualization
plt.grid(color="lightgray", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()

# Save and show the plot
plt.savefig("flight_paths.png", dpi=300)
plt.show()
