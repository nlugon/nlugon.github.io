Cameras are key in a very wide variety of fields including robotics, augmented reality, xx TODO. Fundamentally, cameras simply measure light intensities from different directions over a large array of light-sensitive sensors (pixels), and this consists in a very efficient way to gather a large amount of data on what is around the camera (which is basically what we do with our eyes). Combining this sensor data with some algorithms, cameras then allow for advanced understanding and modeling of the real world in a way that can be interpreted by computers and robots, which allows for advanced perception for physical AI (i.e. robots) and building models of reality for whatever purpose.

Here are some useful online resources I found for building strong fundamentals


# Resource #1 : Lecture: Photogrammetry I & II (2021, Uni Bonn, Cyrill Stachniss)
Here is a first truly great resource on fundamentals on photogrammetry, a YouTube video series by Cyrill Stachniss.

Here is also a short summary of the content of each of the lecture chapters (also provides some handy notes for me and anyone else):


## 1. Introduction to Photogrammetry


## 2. Camera Basics and Propagation of Light


## 3. Image Histograms

## 4. Binary Images


## 5. Local Operators


## 6. Visual Features
### Keypoints
### Feature Descriptors


## 7. Image Segmentation using Mean Shift (no training data involved)



## 8. Classification


## 9. Neural Networks
### Intro
### Gradient Descent
### Backpropagation
