Leveraging Gaussian Processes to predict and correct wheel slip, using periodic pose updates from onboard visual odometry (VO) as approximations of ground truth. The developed pipeline prioritizes most recent and highest-confidence VO pose updates, and predicts uncertainty on slip predictions in addition to the predictions themselves. Results from simulated drives over slopes of 5ยบ to 15ยบ demonstrate reductions in wheel odometry error of 56-78%, and reductions in final pose error of 41%-58% through better initialization of VO.
