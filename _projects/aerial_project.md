This project focused on programming and testing **high-level control for a quadcopter**, first in simulation and then on a real drone. The goal was to develop control strategies that enabled the drone to **search for a landing pad hidden in an obstacle-filled environment, land on it, and then autonomously return to its initial launch pad**.  

## Approach  

- **Simulation (Webots)** – implemented high-level control algorithms for grid search, obstacle-aware navigation, and optimal return path planning in a physics-based environment.  
- **CrazyFlie Testing** – deployed and validated this on a **Bitcraze CrazyFlie** drone, bridging the gap between simulation and real-world flight.
