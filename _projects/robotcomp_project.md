Each year, EPFL selects students to participate in a competition involving the design, build and programming of a fully autonomous robot that collects the highest amount of toys scattered around a room under a fixed amount of time. Toys located in different areas (flat area, carpet area, over-ramp area, behind-sliding-door area) are worth different amounts of points. Out of six teams of three students, achieved 2nd place and received design award.
