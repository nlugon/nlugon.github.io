    Interplanetary cruise and flyby trajectories. With a 21 day launch window starting February 22 2033 and Earth
reentry by November 17 2050, the mission is set to last 17.7 years with a total Î”v budget of 3.55 km/s (1 km/s for cruise and Saturn Orbit Insertion, 0.85 km/s for mission science flybys, 1.2 km/s for Earth return and a 0.5 km/s margin for EOL)

The goal of this project was to design a sample return mission to a moon beyond the asteroid belt. Saturn's Moon Enceladus was selected for its unique plumes of water ice emanating from its south pole.
