Multidisciplinary engineer wildly passionate about drones, robotics, and space.

M.S. in Robotics with Minor in Aerospace and Space at EPFL (Switzerland). B.S. in Mechatronics (also EPFL) with 1-year academic exchange at University of Waterloo (Canada). Specialization in robotic perception and localization. Both actively contributed to or led for multiple student projects, including EPFL’s robot competition, EPFL’s mars rover student design team Xplore, and multiple other semester projects from drone autonomy to satellite imagery processing.
   
Interned with NASA’s lunar rover VIPER for 8 months (April 2024-December 2024). Developed a novel pipeline that improves camera-based localization in challenging lighting environments, with over 50% decrease in localization error. 
   
Since December 2024, playing key roles in multiple unmanned aerial systems (UAS)-related projects at NASA Ames as a multidisciplinary engineer.
   

<!--Dynamic and multidisciplinary Robotics Engineer with a strong foundation in robotic perception and state estimation. Been interning with the Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames Research Center for 8 months (April to December 2024) and conducting research on lunar rover localization for the VIPER mission. Deeply passionate about UAVs, spacecrafts and space robotics. Eager to tackle complex challenges, and particularly love field testing and analyzing/visualizing data through statistical analysis. 

As of mid October 2024, successfully completed my master’s degree in Robotics with minor in Space Technologies at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland.

As of December 2024, joined Metis Technology Solutions Inc. as a Systems Engineer to support aeronautics research at NASA Ames.
